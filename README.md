# dotfiles

This repository contains various configuration files. It is meant to serve as a backup of my dotfiles. Do with it as you please, but under your own risk.

I do have to mention that I merely curated the best from all over the internet. At this time, none of the solutions are mine. Stay tuned for an installation script.
