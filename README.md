# dotfiles

This is a repository containing all my configuration files. On some UNIX systems
these are called dotfiles, since their filenames start with a dot to make them
hidden from the general file view.

## Installation and usage

The easiest way of using these it to use GNU Stow&mdash;a symlink manager&mdash;
to create symlinks to the files that you want. You can find a tutorial [here].
